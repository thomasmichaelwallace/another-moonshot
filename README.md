# Another Moonshot

*A 15 minute "zelda-like".*

You wake up in the wreckage of a ship; the result of a failed moonshot you can barely remember.

The landing has destroyed a village, already on the brink of societal collapse. By helping to solve the villagers problems, you begin to piece together both the ship and reasons you were in it.

After helping heal each villager divisions, you gain another piece of your ship and another ability.

Once you've found five pieces, you realise you have to fire off for another moonshot.

The last shot is you opening your eyes in the wreckage of this second (?) attempt.
